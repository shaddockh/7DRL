# 7DRL 2017

My entry for the 2017 7DRL is an attempt to create a more traditional roguelike.

__Technology__
- Atomic Game Engine
- TypeScript
- VSCode
- Atom
- TSLint
- ROT.js


__Ideas__
- Basic dungeon generation, maybe using ROT
- character graphics .. ascii tileset?
- blueprint library?
- using some common movement components from prior roguelikes
- 2D
- Test using WebView for UI
- Melee only
- Be able to switch from Vi keys to Wasd keys?
- Try to focus on minimal keymap
- Pick up weapon auto equips if the weapon is better
- Potions?  should they auto-consume on pickup?


## Daily Log
