## Editor Extensions
- [ ] Add a "build template blueprint file" to the blueprint extension.  Or maybe configure blueprint lib by adding a stub blueprint file and also adding the require statement to main.js/ts and adding the appropriate d.ts
- [ ] Automatically re-import asset db after generating prefabs
- [ ] look at ways for strongly typing blueprint sections. Maybe have a interface that can be used for both EditorFields and the blueprint...need to make it less painful though.


## Game
[ ] Add some way to configure the tile offset for an entity.  Maybe part of the entity component
[ ] move character
[ ] generate monsters
[ ] bump attack
[ ] potions
[ ] web based ui
[ ] win / lose
